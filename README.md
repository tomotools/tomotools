# tomotools
Scripts to make cryo-electron tomography a bit easier  

## Usage

**Full options can be listed via:**
```
tomotools --help
tomotools [subcommand] --help
```

## Currently supported subcommands:

### Preprocessing & Reconstruction:
- **blend-montages**: Blends SerialEM montages, write results to separate folder.
  - Example: ```tomotools blend-montages MMM*.mrc montages-blended```
- **preprocess**: Prepare tiltseries for reconstruction.
  - Takes data directory from SerialEM or Tomo5 as input and writes the final stacks to the target directory.
  - Frames are aligned using MotionCor2 and reordered if desired. Supports GainRef conversion from dm4 to mrc and the SerialEM-generated defects.txt.
  - Example: ```tomotools preprocess --mcbin 1 --gainref frames/GainRef.dm4 *.mrc ts-aligned```
- **reconstruct**: Perform batch reconstruction using AreTomo or imod.
  - Takes tiltseries and their associated mdoc files as input, automatically identified associated EVN/ODD stacks. Finds alignment using AreTomo, then applies it to EVN/ODD stacks. Alternatively, can move files and then open ```etomo```. Reconstruction is done using imod's ```tilt```.
  - Example: ```tomotools reconstruct --move --bin 4 --sirt 12 --do-evn-odd *.mrc```

### Denoising & Deconvolution
- **cryocare-extract**: Extract cryoCARE training data from EVN/ODD reconstructions.
- **cryocare-train**: Wrapper for cryoCARE training.
- **cryocare-predict**: Wrapper for cryoCARE prediction.
- **deconv**: Python implementation of Dimitry Tegunov's _tom_deconv.m_ script.

### Subtomogram Averaging Preparation
- **imod2warp**: Takes a list of imod directories or a file listing them and prepares everything for Warp or WarpTools.
- **aretomo2warp**: Takes a list of directories with AreTomo-aligned tiltseries or a file listing them and prepares everything for Warp or WarpTools.
- **imod2tomotwin**: Takes a list of imod directories and reconstructs for TomoTwin picking.
- **aretomo2tomotwin**: Takes a list of AreTomo directories and reconstructs for TomoTwin picking.
- **fit-ctf**: Run imod ctfplotter on a set of tiltseries and save results to their folder.
- **merge-dboxes**: Very beta, merges Dynamo DBoxes.
- **reconstruct-3dctf**: Perform reconstruction using imods `ctf3d` function.

### Other
- **semnavigator**: Display SerialEM navigator files to find back you tomogram positions
- **create-movie**: Create a movie from a series of image files.
- **update**: Automatically pulls the most recent version from GitHub and runs ```pip install --upgrade``` on it.
- **restore-frames**: Restore SubFramePath to mdoc of tiltseries preprocessed with tomotools < 0.4. 

## Dependencies
`tomotools` depends on commands from MotionCor2 or MotionCor3, IMOD, and AreTomo 1.X or AreTomo2 for full functionality. IMOD should be in PATH. 
MotionCor2/3 and AreTomo2/3 can either be in PATH as `MotionCor2` /  `MotionCor3` or `AreTomo` / `AreTomo2` respectively, or set using the envar `MOTIONCOR_EXECUTABLE` or `ARETOMO_EXECUTABLE`.

## Installation
We suggest installing tomotools into its own conda / mamba environment. 
If you can only access your userspace, consider using [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html).

If you want to use the scripts interfacing with cryoCARE denoising, please install ```tomotools[cryocare]```. 

### Full Install via:
```
conda create -n tomotools python=3.8 cudatoolkit=11.0 cudnn=8.0 -c conda-forge
conda activate tomotools
pip install "tomotools[cryocare] @ git+https://github.com/tomotools/tomotools.git"
```

### Minimal Install via:
```
conda create -n tomotools python=3.8 -c conda-forge
conda activate tomotools
pip install "tomotools @ git+https://github.com/tomotools/tomotools.git"
```
### Confirm Installation:

With tomotools installed into a conda environment, you can then start tomotools with:
```
conda activate tomotools
tomotools --help
```

### Notes on sbgrid:
If you're using an sbgrid environment, make sure to set the following in your ```.sbgrid.conf``` file:

```
PYTHON_X=3.8.8 (anything > 3.8 works)  
```

Additionally, try ```pip --version``` to make sure it's correctly working. This is required for ```tomotools update```. Else, you can add the following line to your ```.bashrc```:

```
alias pip='python -m pip'
```

Likely, you will also need to add your local Python path to ```.bashrc```:

```
export PATH="/YOURHOMEFOLDER/.local/bin:$PATH"
```
